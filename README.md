## Description

Just Another Text Editor (J.A.T.E) is a text editor that stores code snippets or texts you might keep for yourself.
This project helped me practice making full-stack applications as installable apps.
Jate helps me store code that I plan to use in all my projects so I can work smarter and not harder!
From this project, I learned how to structure my code into a server and client format while learning how to cache my application so I can use the app without the internet.
